# Interactive Operating Sysstem

A fork of a web based Ubuntu 21.10 desktop remake. This fork introduces more apps, UI updates and bug fixes. You can view the page [here](https://angelotrabuco2013.github.io/InteractiveWebOS/).

## Features

* Multi-window (You can open same application 2 (or more) times)
* Resizable, draggable windows
* Changeable wallpapers
* Similar interface with Gnome (Ubuntu Tour imitate Gnome Interface however never use Gnome code.)
* Clone applications

## Why I did it?

I forked the original project by Max, since this project was becoming more and more inactive &amp; unpopular.

## Notes

* Ubuntu Tour is compatible with touch devices. (Window resize on mobile is harder than on computer. And some browsers may not support resize on mobile.)

* This website can't run correctly without server. Because [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) block communication with iframes on `file://`.
